#Bloc Time

Bloc Time is the 2nd AngularJS web app that I created for the front-end course at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io).
This application is a minimalist study timer based off of the pomodoro technique.

###About the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are called pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro, which means tomato. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.

###The Timer

There are 2 components to Bloc Time, a timer and a task list.
To keep this application in its minimalist form, The timer is not adjustable. The timer is first set at 25 minutes for unineruptted work/study. Next, the timer is reset for a 5 minute break. This cycle continues but every 4th cycle the break timer is set for 30 minutes.

###The Task List

Upon signing in via email or Facebook, you are granted access to the task list on the sidebar. The tasks to do are stored on your account so will still be available upon signin on at a later time.
